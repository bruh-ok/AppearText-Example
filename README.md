Welcome, this is my first animation that I am publishing, nothing much and is probably elsewhere, but this is the way that I approached the animation.
Please, feel free to use this animation in any of your webpages, as I certainly will be.

This is the appearing text animation, where the text enters in from outside the container, which makes the magic appearance effect. I designed this using my knowledge of html, css and javascript.

There are 2 versions of this that are enclosed here, one for hovering, and one for the loading of the window.

# Hover effect

For example, the hovering effect is used for cursor hovering, so if you was to hover your cursor over the container of the text (in my example class: appear-overall), then the text will appear from the right, until you take your mouse off the container.

# Onload effect

The other example is of the onload event, which uses the event listener 'load' to make the text appear by itself, without the need to hover your cursor over the container. This one is more ideal for solutions in my opinion, as you can make the text appear at times you need by simply changing the setTimeout's in the javascript file.
